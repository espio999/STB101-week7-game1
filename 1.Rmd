```{r setup}
library(readxl)
Book1 <- read_excel("Book1.xlsx", range = "b13:b26", col_names = FALSE)
df = data.frame(Book1)
```

## assumption
H0: mean = 6.4  
H1: mean < 6.4  
significant level: 5%  

```{r}
t.test(
  df,
  alternative="less",
  mu=6.4
)
```
T test shows true mean is less than 6.4  
P value (0.02158) is less than 5%.  H0 is rejected.  

## conclusion
The average under new system is less than previous waiting system.
